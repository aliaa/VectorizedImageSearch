# Vectorized Image Search
This is an image processing sample project based on [Aforge.Net](http://aforgenet.com) library.<br/>
I've worked on this project on 2011 as a student project and now I'm putting it on github.<br/>
The main approach is that trying to vectorize shapes on images and save their vector data and trying to find similar images based on their vectors.<br/>
Vectorizing in this project means finding curves of shapes and sticking them and just saving the parameters of the curves.<br/>
